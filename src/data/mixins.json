Throw in soy sauce and red wine vinegar. How much depends on your taste. I would start with a tablespoon of each and adjust from there. I like the salad to be a bit more acidic so I tend to add a splash more of the red wine vinegar. Saut\u00e9 mushrooms for a couple of minutes until they are heated through. Season to taste with salt. Adjust soy sauce and red wine vinegar as needed. Before serving, sprinkle a little bit of the wasabi-covered sesame seeds over the mushrooms to impart a little color, crunchiness, and heat. If you are unable to find wasabi-covered sesame seeds, a dab of wasabi and sprinkle of plain sesame seeds should do the trick. \n\nNote: I keep dried shitakes as a staple in my pantry. I love the fact that the water left over after you rehydrate the mushrooms is called mushroom liquor. Mushroom liquor can be used as a substitute for broth or water in many recipes to impart an lovely mushroomy flavor.",

    "recipe": "Technically called arils, pomegranate seeds are tasty little things. They pack a powerfully tart punch, and add some crunch to a taco that might need some textural assistance.\n\n__Instructions__\n\nYou want a pomegranate that feels heavy for its size and has a firm, tight skin. (Weight and firmness are indicators of how much juice is inside.)\n\nHere are two methods for getting the seeds out of the membrane:\n\n___The Water Method___\n\n1. Fill a clean sink or large bowl with cold water (not *too* cold as your hands are going to be working in the water).\n2. Use a small knife to cut out the stem end of the pomegranate, then use your hands to break the whole fruit into large pieces.\n3. Holding the large pieces under the water, use your hands to gently separate the seeds from the membrane. The papery bits will conveniently float to the surface for easy removal.\n\n___The Wooden Spoon Method___\n\n1. Use a small knife to cut out the stem end of the pomegranate, then use your hands to break the whole fruit into two halves.\n2. Loosely hold one of the halves in the palm of your hand, open side down, over a large bowl.\n3. Using a wooden spoon, smack the top, breaking loose the seeds, which will fall into your hand and through your fingers into the bowl.\n\nThis method is quick, but it takes some practice to be able to do it quickly without splashing juice.

    "recipe": "This isn't a tradition, or even particularly traditional -- except in my apartment in Oakland, where I make this for myself ever time I make pork tacos.\n\n#### Ingredients\n* 1 green cabbage\n* 4 limes\n* 2 ears corn, or roughly two cups of corn kernels (adjust to desired corn-y-ness)\n* Dried, Powdered New Mexico Green Chile, to taste\n* Salt, to taste\n* Olive oil\n* Optional: some crumbled cotija or queso Oaxaqueno\n\n#### Directions\n1. If using ears of corn, strip the kernels from them with a sharp knife.\n2. Heat a few tablespoons of oil over high heat. I like to use a Dutch Oven for this, but the main cookware properties you want are heavy-bottomed and wide.\n3. Toss the corn kernels in to the oil, spread them evenly, salt very lightly and let them ride. I _highly_ recommend a splatter guard for this step, but **not** a lid. You want the corn to dry out just a little and get a good sear. It's done when it's starting to get dark, a little chewy, and probably is sticking to the pan.\n4. While the corn is going, core and chop the cabbage in to wide strips.\n5. How's the corn doing?\n6. Juice the limes.\n7. How's the corn doing? If it's not done yet, grab a beer and hang out 'til it is.\n8. The corn is done? Great. Toss it on top of the cabbage. Add a little salt, then a good hit of olive oil, then half-or-so of the lime juice. Toss in a good tablespoon or two of the green chile powder. Start stirring.\n9. You want everything coated nicely, but I don't like the salad too oily, so go easy on that. I add lime until the sour balances the sweet of the corn. I add green chile slowly -- it takes a second to rehydrate and get hot. I might add as much as a half cup of the stuff to a salad for myself or spicy food fans like me; I go easier on the spice-unenthused.\n10. Serve it! If you're in to tossing a little cheese on there, do it -- but I usually just eat it straight. Sometimes this goes on fish or chicken tacos; sometimes it's a side to richer pork tacos. It's always awesome.\n\n**Note on ingredients**: green chile is the gastronomical life blood of New Mexican cuisine, but it's little known in the other 49 states. I like a brand called [_Los Chileros de Nuevo Mexico_](http://www.loschileros.com/), which I can find sometimes in tiendas and other times at Whole Foods (go figure). The trick here is this: just don't accept substitutes. It's not the same. I've also had to accept that fresh chile is just not what this salad needs, so don't do that either (it doesn't distribute well enough across the cabbage). Do have this with cold, crisp beer., vegan",
